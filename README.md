## Raw Data for Research: The Influence of Metaverse Environment Design on the Quality of Experience in Virtual Reality Classes: A Comparative Study

This repository contains anonymized raw data used for the research titled *"The Influence of Metaverse Environment Design on the Quality of Experience in Virtual Reality Classes: A Comparative Study,"* available in the journal **Frontiers in Education**.

The data is anonymized, with each participant represented by an ID. The Zip file includes 4 Excel files:

**FCQ**
This document presents the results of the Final Comparative Questionnaire and some questions about the participants' previous experience. In the responses to the final comparative questionnaire, the applications are ranked from position 1 to 4, with the first application being 1 and the last being 4. The title shows which question it is and what the ranking positions correspond to.

**PEQ**
This document contains the responses to the Post-Experience Questionnaire and a question about any symptoms experienced (if any). Each row corresponds to a participant's responses for a specific metaverse application.

**PRE_POST_Learning_Questionnaire
**Each sheet represents the responses to the Pre- and Post-Learning Questionnaires for a specific metaverse. Cells marked with 1 represent correct answers, and 0 represents incorrect ones.

**LDELTA**
This document presents the learning deltas by person-metaverse. These results are calculated as (Total PostLQ Score – Total PreLQ Score) for the same person by application.

### Study Description

The study investigates how the design of the metaverse environment can affect the quality of the experience in virtual classes. Educational sessions were conducted across four metaverse platforms: **Meta Horizon Workrooms**, **Spatial**, **Mozilla Hubs**, and **Arthur**. Through questionnaire analysis, factors such as:

- Avatars
- Spatial arrangement
- Mobility
- Additional functionalities

were evaluated in relation to participants' concentration, usability, presence, and learning.

### Key Findings

- No significant differences were found in learning outcomes.
- Notable variations in the quality of the classroom experience were identified.
- Higher immersion, concentration, and presence levels were observed in metaverses with limited movement and functionalities.
- Avatars with realistic facial expressions enhanced the overall experience.

### Recommendations

Lessons learned and recommendations for class configurations in the metaverse are presented based on the analysis of the questionnaires.
