## Raw Data for Research: The Influence of Metaverse Environment Design on the Quality of Experience in Virtual Reality Classes: A Comparative Study

This repository contains anonymized raw data used for the research titled *"The Influence of Metaverse Environment Design on the Quality of Experience in Virtual Reality Classes: A Comparative Study,"* available in the journal **Frontiers in Education**.

### Study Description

The study investigates how the design of the metaverse environment can affect the quality of the experience in virtual classes. Educational sessions were conducted across four metaverse platforms: **Meta Horizon Workrooms**, **Spatial**, **Mozilla Hubs**, and **Arthur**. Through questionnaire analysis, factors such as:

- Avatars
- Spatial arrangement
- Mobility
- Additional functionalities

were evaluated in relation to participants' concentration, usability, presence, and learning.

### Key Findings

- No significant differences were found in learning outcomes.
- Notable variations in the quality of the classroom experience were identified.
- Higher immersion, concentration, and presence levels were observed in metaverses with limited movement and functionalities.
- Avatars with realistic facial expressions enhanced the overall experience.

### Recommendations

Lessons learned and recommendations for class configurations in the metaverse are presented based on the analysis of the questionnaires.
